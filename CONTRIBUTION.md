## Roadmap

We have organized the roadmap into a list of features and improvements that we would like to make to Latent Scope in [Milestones](https://github.com/enjalot/latent-scope/milestones).
The goal is to launch [1.0 by the end of 2024](https://github.com/enjalot/latent-scope/milestone/1), which will be a polished and refined version of the current Latent Scope process. This work is being done with the support of the [Mozilla Builders Accelerator](https://future.mozilla.org/builders/2024_cohort/).

We have a set of features planned to advance the UX around clustering and add more methods slated for [2.0](https://github.com/enjalot/latent-scope/milestone/3).

Additionally there are some more speculative research ideas captured in [Research Ideas](https://github.com/enjalot/latent-scope/milestone/2) that focus more on the meta process of comparing embeddings, umaps and clusters.
